            Usually, the pavement condition and roughness data are first used to determine whether it is appropriate to conduct diamond grinding (NMDOT, 2007).
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            First, assess the road to see whether there will be reconstruction or not in the near future. If there will be reconstruction in the assessed road, it is not necessary to conduct diamond grinding.  Second is the Pavement Condition Assessment. Does structure related problems exist? If yes, diamond grinding is not appropriate. If not, does faulting exist? If yes, what is the reason for faulting? If the reason of faulting is structure related, it is not recommended to conduct diamond grinding directly.

        <p class="MsoNormal">
            After selection of projects, the following lists the potential problems associated with diamond grinding and the corresponding solutions. (NMDOT, 2007)(Caltrans, 2007).
        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">
            1) "Dogtails"
        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">
            "Dogtails" refers to the pavement area that are not ground due to lack of horizontal overlap. It is caused by weaving during grinding and can be solved by maintaining the required horizontal overlap between passes and steady steering.

        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">
            2) "Holidays"
        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">
            "Holidays" refers to the areas that are not ground which is caused by isolated low spots in pavement surface. This could be solved by lowering the grinding head and making another pass again since typically it is required that 95 percent of the pavement surface should be covered after grinding.


        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">
            3) Poor vertical match between passes


        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">
            This could be prevented by maintaining a constant down-pressure.
        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">
            4) Too much or too little materials removed near joints


        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">
            When this happens, wide gaps can be temporarily grouted to provide a smooth surface.
        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">
            5)	Too much slurry on pavement during grinding
        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">
            This is caused by vacuum unit or skirt surrounding the cutting head, and when this phenomenon happens, the grinding operation should be stopped and equipment inspected immediately.
        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">
            <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">
                <u>Field Operation<o:p></o:p></u>
            </b>
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            Once the road is determined to conduct diamond grinding, the diamond grinding will be performed continuously along a traffic lane and also started and ended perpendicular to the pavement centerline. Typically, it includes 4 phases:


        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">
            1)	Preparation
        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">
            Make sure no structure related deficiencies exist before diamond grinding operation.
        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">
            2)	Grinding


        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">
            Grinding is always along a traffic lane and a continuous operation. A diamond saw blade with a cutting head of at least 36 in. in width is used to grind longitudinally. Several machines working together allows a lane to be completed in one pass, thus improving productivity in large projects. One machine and several passes with 2 in. of minimum overlap are used for small projects. The grinding equipment uses water to cool the cutting head. (InDOT, 2010) Generally, at least 95% percent of the whole area within any 3 foot by 100 foot test area should be grinded after the diamond grinding procedure. Isolated low spots of less than 2 square feet should not require texturing if lowering the cutting head would be required. (NMDOT, 2007) And since the cutting head is narrow, more than one pass will be needed for the grinding equipment.


        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">
            3)	Cleaning


        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">
            Make sure that slurry/residue from the grinding operation are properly removed.


        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">
            4)	Filling/Resealing
        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">
            &nbsp;Joints and cracks should be sealed or filled.


        </p>

                <u>Final Surface Finish<o:p></o:p></u>
            </b>
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            The ground pavement surface shall be uniform after diamond grinding.  The following Table shows the specifications by FHWA, 2015.
        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">Adjusting the blade spacing may be necessary to achieve the specified texture listed above.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Thickness is one of the most sensitive factors affecting cracking performance of concrete pavements, and diamond grinding does reduce pavement thickness, so the thickness can be a concern to concrete pavement. Diamond grinding generally reduces slab thickness by 4 to 6 mm (0.10 to 0.25 in) (Rao et al. 1999) (Drakopoulos et al. 1998).</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">A cracking model result indicated that a 5-mm (¼ in) reduction in slab thickness results in about 30 percent reduction in fatigue life if the concrete strength remains constant However, long-term strength of concrete is significantly higher than the design strength (typically the 28-day strength) (Rao et al. 1999). If the increase in concrete strength is considered, the small reduction in slab thickness has negligible effect on service life. These results suggest that a typical concrete pavement may be ground up to three times without compromising its fatigue life (Rao et al. 1999). In practice, some States have ground concrete pavements up to three times without reporting any problems (i.e., California and Georgia) (Correa and Wong 2001).</p>
