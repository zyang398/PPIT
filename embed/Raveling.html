<h1>Raveling</h1>
<h2>Description: </h2>
<p>This condition is the progressive disintegration of the pavement surface. It is caused by traffic action on a weak surface. Aggregate particles become dislodged from the binder and this loss of material can progress through the entire layer. Raveling ranges in severity from the loss of a substantial number of surface stones to the loss of a substantial portion of the asphalt surface layer. For purposes of rating, a slurry seal that has “peeled off” is considered level 3 Raveling. </p>
<h2>How to measure:</h2>
<p>The percent of the length of the rated segment ( mile or partial mile ) that contains raveling is to be recorded along with the predominant severity level. For example, if you observed 3000 feet of raveling in a 1 mile rating segment with 1000 feet rated as level 1 severity and 2000 feet rated as level 2 severity, you would record as 60% level 2 raveling as 3000/5000 = 60% and level 2 is more predominant ( 2000 ft. &gt; 1000 ft. ). </p>
