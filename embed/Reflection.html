<h1>Reflection Cracking</h1>
<p>This type cracking is caused by the “reflection” of joints and cracks through an asphaltic concrete overlay from the <strong>underlying PCC concrete pavement</strong>. These reflection cracks begin as tight cracks and progress to very wide cracks with spalling. The transverse cracks will be right angles across the roadway and in a repeatable pattern down the roadway ( i.e., every 30 feet, 40 feet, etc.). The longitudinal cracks, if present, will normally be fairly straight, continuous cracks in the travel lane near the pavement edge associated with underlying edge of narrower PCC concrete pavement which has been widened and overlaid with asphaltic concrete overlay. Longitudinal cracks that occur at the centerline, lane lines, and edge lines are not to be counted. Any other cracks will be cracks associated with failures in underlying PCC concrete pavement and such cracks will reflect the size and shape of such failures. Construction joints and widening joints associated with the construction and/or widening of asphalt pavements are not to be counted as reflection cracking. Remember, reflection cracking only occurs on roadways with an underlying PCC concrete pavement. </p>
<h2>Severity Level 1 Reflection Cracking</h2>
<p>Level 1 Reflection cracks are tight, single cracks that are usually transverse, but are longitudinal if the underlying concrete pavement is narrower than the asphaltic concrete overlay. Irregular cracking patterns can be reflected if the underlying slabs are broken. Level 1cracks may or may not go across the entire lane.</p>

<h2>Severity Level 2 Reflection Cracking </h2>
<p>This level of reflection cracking has progresses so that all underlying joints and cracks have reflected through the surface layer. The cracks are substantially wider than the level 1 cracks and may require sealing. There may be some “double” cracks over the underlying concrete pavement joints. “Double” cracks are not to be counted as two cracks, but one reflection crack. A longitudinal crack in the travel lane near the edge of pavement that is a result of widening of the underlying concrete pavement with asphalt will be counted as a reflection crack. If the underlying pavement is not concrete, do not count. A widening crack is not necessarily a reflection crack.</p>

<h2>Severity Level 3 Reflection Cracking </h2>
<p>This level of reflection cracking will have the same pattern as level 2 reflection cracking (all underlying joints and cracks have reflected through), but the cracks will be very wide. The cracks will be marked by spalling and/or subsidence. It should be obvious that some corrective work should be performed to these cracks before counting them as level 3.</p>
