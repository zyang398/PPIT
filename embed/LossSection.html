<h1>Loss of Section</h1>
<h2>Definition:</h2>
<p>A deviation of the pavement surface from its original typical design cross section other than those described for corrugations, pushing or shoving. Generally, loss of pavement section results from settlement, slope failure, or heavy loads on a deficient pavement system. This loss of section usually occurs in the outside half of the lane. Loss of section takes the form of dips, bumps, and undulations, all of which cause pitch and role in a moving vehicle. </p>
<h2>How to Measure: </h2>
<p>The percentage of the length of rated segment ( mile or portion of mile) that has loss of pavement section. The three severity levels are as follows: </p>
<p>Level 1 ( Slight ): Noticeable swaying of vehicle, but no effect on vehicle control. </p>
<p>Level 2 ( Moderate ): Heavy swaying of vehicle. Fair control of vehicle, driver has to anticipate dips ahead. </p>
<p>Level 3 ( Severe ): Speed of vehicle must be greatly reduced for driver to maintain control. </p>
<p>The predominant severity, in the rater’s judgment, is also recorded on the rating form under severity. For example, in a rating segment of one mile, you observe 3000 feet level 1 and 2000 feet level 2, you would record as 100% level 1 loss of pavement section as 3000 + 2000 = 100% and level 1 is more predominant ( 3000’ &gt; 2000’ ).</p>
