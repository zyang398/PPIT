<h1>Patches, Potholes, and Local Base Failures </h1>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>Patches are repaired sections of the asphalt pavement due to localized pavement and/or base failures. Also spot leveling is included in this category as well. </p>
<p>Potholes are sections of the asphalt pavement that have failed and formed a hole in the pavement structure. These are caused by pavement and/or base failures. </p>
<p>Base Failures are sections of roadway where the water has entered the base material and is rutting and shoving . </p>
<h2>How to measure </h2>
<p>The total number of spot overlays, patches, potholes and local base failures must be counted for the entire rated segment (normally a mile) and this number recorded on the COPACES survey form. Utility patches are NOT to be counted UNLESS the utility patch has failed and is thus affecting the structural condition of the pavement.</p>
