        <p class="MsoNormal">After the sealant material has been selected for a joint resealing project, the installation procedure should be paid careful attention to ensure the performance of the sealant. It is noted that joint sealing is often required in conjunction with other preservation activities, and the same general steps are followed in those applications. In all cases, successful sealing projects require close attention to detail.</p>

        <h5><i>Hot-Applied Thermoplastic Sealant Materials</i></h5>



        <p class="MsoNormal">After the surface preparation and equipment installation, the sealant material should be installed in a uniform manner, filling the reservoir from the bottom up to avoid trapping any air bubbles. For recessed configurations, the joint reservoir should typically be filled no higher than 3–6 mm (0.125–0.25 in.) below the surface of the pavement to allow room for sealant expansion during the summer when the joint closes, thus preventing the sealant from being pulled out by traffic. For flush-fill and overband configurations, the joint reservoir should be overfilled and the sealant struck-off as needed to form the specified configuration. Figure below shows the installation of a hot-applied sealant material in a joint resealing project.</p>

        </p>
        <h5><i>Cold-Applied Thermosetting Sealant Materials</i> </h5>



        <p class="MsoNormal">Same as the thermoplastic materials, after the surface preparation, the silicone sealants should be installed in a uniform manner. The sealants should be installed form the bottom to the top of joint, to ensure that no air is entrapped. The nonself-leveling silicone sealants must be tooled to force the sealant around the backer rod and against the joint sidewalls. This tooling should also form a concave sealant surface with the lowest point being about 6 mm (0.25 in.) below the pavement surface. Successful tooling has been accomplished using such devices as a rubber hose on the end of a fiberglass rod or pieces of a large-diameter backer rod. Figure below shows the tooling operation.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><o:p>&nbsp;<img alt="" height="300" src="images/jointsealing6.png" width="500" class="w3-image" /></o:p></p>

        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Self-leveling silicone sealants do not require this tooling operation. However, workers should take care of placing the backer rod for self-leveling silicone sealants, because the sealant can easily flow around a loose backer rod prior to curing and may flow out at the joint ends if not properly blocked. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">When installing both silicone and thermoplastic sealants, such as in a project with silicone sealant in the transverse joints and hot-applied thermoplastic materials in the longitudinal joint, the silicone should be installed first to reduce the potential for contamination of the transverse joint during the longitudinal joint sealing operations.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Polysulfide and polyurethane sealants require a curing period to gain their strength and resiliency, similar to silicone. In addition, these sealants require a special application nozzle and careful control of the application equipment.</p>

            </b>
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Both hot-applied thermoplastic sealant materials and cold-applied thermosetting sealant materials should be placed only when the air temperature is at least 4ºC (40ºF) and rising (FHWA 2002).</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">
                <u>Traffic Considerations <o:p></o:p></u>
            </b>
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Proper traffic control plans should be developed and maintained before and during the joint resealing. Traffic should not be allowed on the newly sealed joints for about 30 minutes to 1 hour after sealant placement to avoid “tracking” of the sealant.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">
                <u>Surface Preparation <o:p></o:p></u>
            </b>
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The first step of the joint resealing process is to remove the old sealant from the joint, along with any incompressible. Initial removal can be done by any procedure that does not damage the joint itself. The second step is refacing. It provides a clean surface for bonding with the new sealant and to establish a reservoir with the desired shape factor.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Refacing is generally done using a water-cooled saw with diamond blades. These saws may use a single sawblade or may use multiple blades ganged together to provide the desired cutting width. Figure below shows the ganged sawblades. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><o:p>&nbsp;<img alt="" height="300" src="images/jointsealing7.png" width="500" class="w3-image" /></o:p></p>

        <b>Ganged sawblades to provide desired cutting width(From CPTech Center)</b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"><o:p></o:p></span>
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Generally, a joint should be widened by no more than 2 mm (0.08 in.) total during the refacing operation. This will limit the amount of concrete that is removed, increase production, and limit the width of the joint through successive joint resealing operations. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">After the joint refacing, the joint should be with high-pressure air followed by light sandblasting. It helps to remove the laitance and any other residue on the joint faces. Air compressors used with the sandblasters must be equipped with working water and oil traps to prevent contamination of the joint bonding faces. </p>

                <u>Longitudinal Joint Resealing<o:p></o:p></u>
            </b>
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Longitudinal joints between adjacent concrete pavement slabs, and the longitudinal joint between the mainline concrete pavement and an HMA shoulder should also be addressed as part of a resealing operation. The procedures are almost same as transverse joint resealing. However, there are some additional considerations.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Longitudinal joints between adjacent concrete slabs are found between adjacent traffic lanes or between a concrete mainline pavement and a concrete shoulder. Because of the limited amount of movement that occurs at these joints, no reservoir is formed and they are sealed with a hot-poured thermoplastic material. The longitudinal joint between a concrete mainline pavement and an HMA shoulder can be a very difficult joint to seal. The differences in the thermal properties of each material and the differences in the structural cross section often result in large differential horizontal and vertical movements. Also adding to this movement can be the curling/warping of the concrete, the lack of a tie between the concrete mainline and the HMA shoulder, and frost heave/swelling in the subgrade beneath the shoulder. A sufficiently wide reservoir be cut in the existing HMA shoulder to allow for the anticipated vertical movements.</p>
