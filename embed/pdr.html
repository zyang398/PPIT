        <p class="MsoNormal">Since the Concrete Pavement Restoration (CPR) concept is widely known to almost all the transportation angencies, which is mentioned in previous chapter on Diamond Grinding, this chapter moves on to the “Partial Depth Repair” topic. Seen from the Figure below, Partial Depth Repair (PDR) is in the middle phase of CPR.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><o:p>&nbsp;<img alt="" height="300" src="images/PDR1.png" width="350" class="w3-image" /></o:p></p>

        <p class="auto-style1" style="layout-grid-mode: char;" align="center">
            <b>CPR techniques (ACPA, 1997)</b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"><o:p></o:p></span>
        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">Partial Depth Repair is used in most cases to treat spalling and  surface scaling. If severe scaling is shown in a small areas, PDR can also be used(ACPA, 1998). It improves the rideability of concrete pavement, thus contributing to reduced moisture infiltration and intrusion of incompressibles into joints(ACPA, 1997 ), and also restores a uniform, well defined joint sealant reservoir prior to joint resealing (Frentress & Harrington, 2012).</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">For patching practices usage in US with both asphalt and concrete patching included, currently, almost all U.S. states (44 out of 49) use pavement patching except only a few states (five of 49), mainly because that the probability of having freezing temperatures in those areas is very low which means that they don’t have to consider patching to be a major component of their maintenance programs. The distribution of the patching practice usage is shown in Figure below. (Rebecca S. McDaniel, 2014).A detailed survey results about whether states monitor the performance of reactive and planned patches, whether an established method to track patch locations exsits, whether states organization have any QC/QA procedures at the time of patch placement are also include in the report(Rebecca S. McDaniel, 2014). The distress problems that patching can treat is similar and the trigger timing for patching is also similar for the states and local agencies. Engineering focus of patching is to determine 1) where to patch, 2) when to patch, 3) type of patch, and 4) situations that patching is not appropriate(Rebecca S. McDaniel, 2014).</p>

        </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">Common procedure for Partial Depth Repair is that first identify the removal area by chain dragging and hammering the surface to find the area limits, then the removal area is marked out for further cleaning (sand blasting and air blasting). After this, concrete placement will be done to the removal area.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">Partial-depth repairs usually includes 3 types: Spot repair, Long joint/crack repair and Bottom half repair. Spot repair and Long joint/crack repair are standard partial-depth repairs which is shown in Figures below. Bottom half repairs are developed for special repairs including the bottom half of the slab. Spot repairs are usually between 10 in. and 6 ft long which is typically used for pavements where the existing load transfer devices (if any) are still functional(Daniel P. Frentress, 2011). Long joint/crack repairs are usually between 6 ft and one-third to one-half the depth of the concrete pavement in transverse and longitudinal joints. Figure below is a deteriorated pavement corner that Bottom half repairs can be used. It should be noted that this repair is for work performed in the bottom half of the pavement and its use should only be applied to edges or cross-joint locations and not exceed 18 in. long (Daniel P. Frentress, 2011). For this study, we mainly focus the type 1 and type 2 PDR.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">Noticeably, especially for CPRP, because the full depth repair need to cut to the full depth, which will affect the load transfer, while PDR can keep the continuity of the longitudinal steel to maintain the transverse repair joints(Jungheum Yeon, 2012).</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">After the brief review of the partial depth patching, this guide will first discuss the application of PDP in Section 1.2 including Functions, Project Selection (Proper candidates), Timing, after that Material , Equipment Inspection, Weather Requirement, Traffic Control and Construction steps are introduced in detail. Finally, the Performance Evaluation and Cost are discussed. Following that is the performance section of the PDP, and at last, the cost of PDP is discussed.</p>
