<h1>Corrugation/Pushing</h1>
<h2>Definition: </h2>
<p>A series of ridges and valleys in the surface which cause a rippling or washboarding effect caused by unstable asphalt on asphaltic concrete or non-uniform application of aggregate on surface treatment. </p>
<h2>How to Measure:</h2>
<p>The extent will be recorded as the percentage of the rated segment ( mile or partial mile) length that has corrugations. For example, if you observed in a mile rating segment that three interchanges ( No. 1 –700 feet level 1, No. 2 –800 feet level 2, and No. 3 –500 feet level 3) had corrugations/pushing, you would record as 40% and level 2 corrugation/pushing, as 700 + 800 + 500 = 40% and level 2 is more predominant ( 800’ &gt; 700’ &gt; 500’ ).</p>

<p>Level 1 – corrugations are visible and can definitely be felt in the steering wheel while driving</p>

<p>Level 2 – corrugations/pushing have significant effect on riding comfort, some reduction of speed may be necessary </p>

<p>Level 3 – noticeable discomfort, excessive vibration, reduction of speed necessary </p>
