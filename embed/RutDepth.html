<h1>Rut Depth</h1>
<h2>Definition: </h2>
<p>Rutting is longitudinal depressions that form under traffic in the wheelpaths and are greater than 20 feet long. Rutting is a permanent deformation of the wheelpaths caused by traffic loadings. Rutting can be caused by insufficient compaction, plastic movement of the mix, or an unstable foundation. </p>
<p>According to its definition, the following questions may be addressed when identifying rutting distress. </p>
<p>1. Compared with the pavement outside the wheelpaths, is there any depression deformation in the wheelpaths? </p>
<p>2. Is this deformation in the longitudinal direction? </p>
<p>3. Is there any cracking in the longitudinal direction which is associated with the deformation in the wheelpaths?</p>
<h2>How to Measure: </h2>
<p>Rut Depth will be estimated in both wheelpaths in the sample area and recorded on the survey in units of 1/8 of an inch. If rutting is extensive (more than 3/8 inch), actual measurement may be necessary. </p>
<p>Severity levels for Rutting are not applicable.</p>
