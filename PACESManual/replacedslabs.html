<h1>Replaced Slabs</h1>
<h2>Definition:</h2>
<p>A count of all slabs with new (since the last CPACES cycle) slab replacements will be made within each mile. Recent replacements may not be so obvious because the color and texture can be similar to older replacements.    In this case estimates can be made based on the condition of the joint sealant as compared to other nearby slabs.  The joint sealant may appear newer for the replaced slab.  </p>

<p>All replaced slabs will be marked in each mile as they occur. If there is a replaced slab and a cracked slab within the same 20 foot or 30 foot section count both the replaced slab and the broken slab. Furthermore, if a replacement is on both sides of the original joint each slab replacement is counted.  While there aren't any deduction points for replaced slabs it is good to get an account of how many slabs have been replaced for predictive purposes.</p>
