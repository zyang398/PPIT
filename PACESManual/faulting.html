<h1>Faulting </h1>
<h2>Faulting Measurements</h2>
<p>The faulting of every eighth original joint is measured using an electronic meter first built by GDOT personnel, termed the Georgia Faultmeter.  Original joints are defined as joints that have not been moved or replaced from the original construction, as noted in Figure 1.  As each reading is taken it should be recorded. Be sure to include the minus sign if the meter reads a -1, -2, etc.  The only exception is -0 since this is the same as zero.  Try to enter the number as soon as the reading is taken so the location is better approximated.</p>

<p>There should be approximately 22 faulting readings per mile for 30-foot joint spacing, 33 for 20-foot spacing and 44 for 15-foot spacing.  Mainline bridges and ramps will reduce the number of readings.  The Electronic Faultmeter was designed to simplify measuring joint faulting.  It reads out directly in 32nds of an inch and shows whether the reading is positive or negative.  The unit reads out in 1second and freezes the reading in a display so it can be removed from the road before reading for a safer operation.  Calibrate the meter at the beginning of each day and after lunch. To operate the unit, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>(1) Calibrate the meter at the beginning of each day and after lunch.  Although the meter is very stable, it should be checked at the beginning of each day and after lunch to assure correct readings.  Set the meter on the calibration block with the front end lined up with the cal. 12 mark.  If a reading of 12 is not obtained, initially, push the button several more times to insure stability.  In this position the probe rests on a 3/8 inch block.  Press the button, as 3/8 inch = 12/32, a reading of 12 is obtained.  Set the meter to line up with the zero mark.  Press the button.  The meter should read zero.  As long as the zero and 12 readings are obtained, the unit is working properly.  If not, discontinue testing and call the Maintenance Liaison so the problem can be corrected.  See Figure 2(a) for calibrating the meter.</p>
<p>(2) Check orientation of the meter.  Grip the handle of the meter with the thumb resting lightly on the test button.  The operator should stand safely on the shoulder facing traffic while making the test.  There is an arrow on the meter showing traffic direction.  The faultmeter must be oriented correctly to get accurate readings, show shown in Figure 2(b).</p>
<p> (3) Wait for a break in traffic.  Be sure to wait for a break in traffic before testing.  Do not wave traffic over.</p>
<p>(4) Set the meter.  Set the meter on the leave side of the joint approximately 6 inches inside the white line.  A probe contacts the slab on the approach slab.  The joint must be centered between the two marks on each side of the meter.</p>
<p>(5) Perform the test.  Push, then instantly release the test button.  A 1-second tone will sound.</p>
<p>(6) Move out of traffic and record the reading.  As soon as the tone stops, lift the meter and move away from the roadway.  The meter will remain "frozen" until the next reading is taken.  This allows the operator to move away from traffic before the meter is read.  Hand signals can be used to communicate the reading to the tablet operator.</p>

<p>Should the batteries need replacing, the reading will still lock in the display after 1 second, but  the 1 second continuous tone will be followed by a 3 second pulsating tone and "LO BATI" will show in the display.  The readings will still be accurate but the batteries should be replaced within a day or so.</p>
<p>The Faulting Index (FI) is an indication of the level of faulting in a section.  The FI is computed by averaging the individual faulting numbers, then multiplying the result by 5 to provide a ‘hypothetical’ level of faulting per 5 slabs.  In this way, a FI of 20 is equivalent to an average faulting of 4/32nds (or 1/8) of an inch per slab.</p>
