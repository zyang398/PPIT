<h1>Edge Distress</h1>
<h2>Definition:</h2>
<p>Edge distress is cracking and pavement edge break-off within 1 to 2 foot of the pavement edge and not associated with the wheelpath area. The cracking can be in the form of longitudinal or transverse cracks or in many instances alligator type cracking. It may sometimes be difficult to distinguish between alligator cracking in the wheelpath and along the edge of the pavement especially on narrow width pavements. <strong>It must be called load cracking when it occurs in the wheelpath. It cannot be called both load cracking and edge distress. </strong></p>
<h2>How to Measure: </h2>
<p>The percent of the rated segment ( mile or partial mile) length containing edge distress is recorded on the survey form along with the predominant severity level in the rater’s judgment. For example, if you observed edge distress on these curves (curve 1 --700’ level 1, curve 2 –1000’ level 2, and curve 3 –300’ level 3 ) within a mile rating segment, you would record as 40% level 2 edge distress as 700 + 1000 + 300 = 2000/5280 = 40% and level 2 was more predominant (1000’ &gt; 700’ &gt; 300’ ). </p>

<p>Level 2 – crack widths greater than ¼ inch, double cracking, tight “alligator” cracking</p>
