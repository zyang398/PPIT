<h1>Joint With Spall </h1>
<h2>Definition:</h2>
<p>The deterioration of concrete at the joint usually results in the breaking or flaking off of the concrete at the joint; as they worsen raveling and pop-outs occur.  Figure 12 shows examples of joints with spalls.  The number or severity of spalls is not accounted for, just the total number of joints with spalls; therefore, if a joint has two or more spalls a single entry is made showing one spalled joint.  According to the specifications, a spall must be at least 1.5" x 6" in area.  We will use this minimum size to define the minimum spall size.</p>
