<h1>Joints With Patched Spall </h1>
<h2>Definition:</h2>
<p>Only well performing spall patches are counted.  Spalls patched with asphalt should be counted as spalls rather than patched spalls because the asphalt patched is only a temporary repair until the area can be sawed out and patched with concrete.</p>
