<h1>Shoulder Joint Distress</h1>
<h2>Definition:</h2>
<p>Depressions in the shoulder caused by the vertical movement in concrete slabs under load; this may cause material to be pumped out at the joint.  The shoulder joint will be visually inspected for distress. This distress is caused by slab movement under load and usually occurs at the joints. The distress takes the form of a depressed pot hole at the joint. This distress can advance to the extent of large holes at the joints and base material pumped out onto the shoulder.  There are two severity levels for shoulder joint distress.</p>

<h2>How to measure: </h2>
<p>Severity level 1- Obvious depressions adjacent to longitudinal joints. Depressions are not large enough to require patching. No "pumping" of base material onto the shoulder is present.</p>
<p>Severity level 2 - Large, deep depressions adjacent to transverse joints. Depressions are large enough to require patching. The "pumping" of base material onto the shoulders should be rated severity level 2 regardless of depression size.</p>

<p>Figure 1.Images of shoulder joint distress with different severity levels.</p>
<p>The percentage of the mile affected by shoulder joint distress will be estimated and noted as a percentage (See Figure 2).  There can be a situation where both severity levels are present within a given mile.  If this occurs just note the percentages of affected area for each severity level, recognizing that the total percentage (SL1 and SL2) must be 100% or less. </p>
