<h1>Transverse Cracks </h1>
<h2>Definition:</h2>
<p>A transverse crack normally begins at the center line of the longitudinal joint and travels perpendicular (or at a slight angle) to traffic across the slab. The crack starts out as a tight hairline fracture continuing on to become a wide moving break through the entire depth of the slab.</p>
<p>Every slab with a transverse crack in the outside lane of each mile will be visually counted. There are two severity levels for transverse crack.  The severity levels are related to the width and condition of the crack as described below.
<h2>How to measure: </h2>
<p>Severity level 1- The slab has a hairline and "tight'' working crack regardless of its length.</p>
<p>Severity level 2 - The slab is cracked from joint to joint and has a moving crack that may be wide (>1/4‚Äù), spalled and needs to be sealed; in your opinion, the slab is actually broken.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows examples of Severity Levels 1 and 2.  With these two severity levels we can get an accurate account of all slabs that may be cracked or broken transversely and we can pin-point those slabs that require replacement.  Once these locations are noted our maintenance forces can schedule rehabilitation work to prevent further deterioration.  Never count the same type distress more than once per slab; if a slab has one transverse crack, count it as one transverse crack for whatever severity level it is.  If a slab has both severity level cracks, count only the worst of the two severity levels (See Figure 2).  Slabs that have transverse and longitudinal cracking in the same slab will not be counted as transverse cracks, instead they will be noted as shattered slabs.</p>
