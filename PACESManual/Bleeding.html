<h1>Bleeding/Flushing </h1>
<h2>Definition:</h2>
<p>Bleeding or flushing is the presence of bituminous material on the surface creating a shiny appearance. Bleeding or flushing is created by excess asphalt cement and/or low air void content.</p>
<h2>How to measure: </h2>
<p>The percent of the length of the wheelpaths that has bleeding or flushing in the rated segment ( mile or partial mile ) is noted. Each wheelpath is a maximum of 50 percent of the rated segment ( mile or partial mile ). For example, if you observed that one wheelpath had 3000 feet level 1 bleeding and other wheelpath had 1000 feet level 2 bleeding in a rated segment of 1 mile, you would record as 40% level 1 bleeding/flushing since 3000 ft. = 30% + 1000 ft. = 10% or 40% total both wheelpaths and level 1 is more predominant ( 3000’ &gt; 1000’ ). </p>
