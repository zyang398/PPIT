<h1>Longitudinal Cracks </h1>
<h2>Definition:</h2>
<p>A longitudinal crack normally starts at a transverse joint and generally runs parallel with traffic. These cracks can occur in or outside the wheel path.  If in the wheelpath, over time the cracks can spall and begin to ravel out.</p>
<p>Every slab with a longitudinal crack in the outside lane of each mile will be visually counted. Remember, slabs with longitudinal cracks are counted, not the number of longitudinal cracks.  There are two severity levels for Longitudinal Crack.  The severity levels are related to the width and condition of the crack.</p>
<h2>How to measure: </h2>
<p>Severity level 1-The longitudinal crack is a hairline and "tight" working crack.</p>
<p>Severity level 2 - The slab is cracked from joint to joint.  A moving longitudinal crack is generally wider (>1/4‚Äù) and may be spalled, and needs to be sealed.</p>
<p>Figure 5 shows examples of Severity Levels 1 and 2.  The highest severity longitudinal crack on a slab is counted if both severity levels are found on one slab. Also, if a longitudinal crack is present on both sides of the joint each slab is counted as having a longitudinal crack. (See Figure 6). If a slab has two severities (e.g., two level 1 longitudinal cracks and one level 2 longitudinal crack), the slab is counted as one slab with severity level 2 longitudinal cracks. As the distresses are being identified click the appropriate location on the tablet PC, be sure to click only once for each cracked slab.</p>
<P>Slabs that have longitudinal and transverse cracking in the same slab will not be counted as longitudinal cracks, instead they will be noted as shattered slabs.</P>
