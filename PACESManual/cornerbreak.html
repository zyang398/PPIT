<h1>Corner Break </h1>
<h2>Definition:</h2>
<p>A crack that occurs at a corner of the slab, running from a transverse joint to the shoulder joint or from a  transverse joint to the center longitudinal joint.  Figure 7 shows an example of corner break.  If the cracking is not located more than 1 foot off both joints it should be termed a joint spall instead of a Corner Break. Slabs will be visually inspected for the presence of Corner Break (See Figure 1).   Remember, slabs with corner breaks are counted, not the number of corner breaks on the slab.</p>

<h2>How to measure: </h2>
<p>There are no severity levels for Corner Break.  If the slab is completely cracked at a corner (from joint to joint) identify the slab as having a Corner Break. </p>
<p>Slabs that have a corner break and other (longitudinal or transverse) cracking in the same slab can be called corner break if that is the worst distress in the slab (i.e. no other SL 2 cracks, transverse or longitudinal), otherwise they should be noted as shattered slabs (see Page 2).</p>
