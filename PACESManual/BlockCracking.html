<h1>Block/Transverse Cracking</h1>
<p>This type cracking is caused by weathering of the pavement or shrinkage of cement treated base materials. Block/transverse cracking is not load related. The block pattern is distributed uniformly throughout the roadway and not concentrated in the wheelpaths. Block cracking is interconnecting cracks forming a series of large blocks usually with sharp corners.</p>
<p>Block/transverse cracking begins as single, tight transverse, longitudinal or combinations of both types of cracks. In the beginning, block/transverse cracks may not form a recognizable block pattern, just longitudinal and/or transverse cracks that are not associated with the wheelpaths.</p>
<p>As this type of cracking progresses, a definite block pattern occurs and the cracks become wider. As the cracking becomes worse, the block pattern densifies (small blocks) and/or the cracks become very wide (&gt; 1/8 inch).</p>
<h2>Severity Level 1 Block/Transverse Cracking</h2>
<p>This type cracking is not load related and does not occur in the wheelpaths. Level 1 block/transverse cracking is made up of transverse, longitudinal, or a combination of both types of cracks. A definite “block” pattern has not developed yet. The longitudinal cracks are tight and not in the wheelpaths although they may wander into the wheelpaths at times.</p>
<p>The illustration below would be considered to have level 1 block/transverse cracking on 100 percent of the sample area. See Rule of 100 feet for estimating the extent of level 1 block/transverse cracking.</p>

<h2>Severity Level 2 Block/Transverse Cracking</h2>
<p>At this severity level, the cracking has developed definite block patterns. Some of the longitudinal cracks can occur in the wheelpaths for short distances without being considered load cracking when associated with a block pattern. The transverse and longitudinal cracks are wider than in level 1, but do not necessarily require sealing. The block pattern will usually be uniform across the entire roadway.</p>
<p>In the following example, 80% of the sample area has level 2 block/transverse cracking. However, this example is for illustrative purposes only. It is either present (100%) or not present (0%) and rarely falls in between.</p>

<h2>Severity Level 3 Block/Transverse Cracking</h2>
<p>At this severity level, the cracking has a definite block pattern as in level 2, but the blocks are smaller and the cracks are wider than in level 2. Level 3 block/transverse cracking is marked by cracks that are wide enough to require sealing. Block cracking that has a very large number of small blocks is also considered to be level 3 block/transverse cracking. Some of the longitudinal cracks in this pattern may meander into the wheelpaths for short distance, but are still considered block cracking because large distances of wheelpaths are not affected and this type cracking is not caused by loading. Some spalling of the cracking may be evident.</p>
<p>The following example represents 100% level 3 block/transverse cracking.</p>
